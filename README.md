# Skils in Place

Born from the Swedish **hack the crisis** event April 3-6 2020

## Pitch
Skills in Place: A fast, smart and simple way to match people’s skills, passions and experiences
with the work that is needed right now, nearby to fight the crisis. With SiP the chat-bot,
targeted training and information, this platform brings people together so that everybody can
contribute, voluntarily or paid. A unique way for skills to find new places and for people to
discover their passions.

## Problem Description
People are losing their jobs - while critical sectors, needed to maintain the basic requirements
of our society, are lacking human resources. The current solutions are not efficient enough to
aid in reallocating the workforce. It is of highest priority to keep our society on its feet and
make it easy for motivated individuals to find how to quickly pitch in where their current skills,
with little or no training, can come to good use - particularly in their local community.

## Solution Description
Skills in Place is a platform to efficiently reallocate the workforce to where it is most needed.
By taking not only people’s previous experiences into account, but also their motivations, values
and soft skills, an AI chatbot matches people with job openings or volunteering positions they
might never have thought of, or found themselves.

Along with the matching, the job seekers will get information about training necessary to start
the job they have been matched for, together with appropriate information about eventual payment
and location. The platform also connects the job seeker with the organisation offering the job
in order to get the conversation between the two parts started.

By gathering information from many people, the AI chatbot will make the matching more accurate
as the time passes. It will also give suggestions on what type of jobs other people with similar
background and soft skills have started. By introducing what others have gone for, the platform
decreases doubts and encourages people to test something new that makes an enjoyable
contribution in their local community.

**Example:**

An actor wants to help. His theatre is closed for visitors and all her rehearsals are postponed.
He’s good at singing, playing the piano, reading aloud, and he loves talking to people and enjoys
doing favours for people. He has some acrobat training and considers himself quite strong when it
comes to lifting and carrying things.

The Big Elder Care needs help. They publish an add:

“At our institution visitors are no longer allowed due to the epidemic. Our residents need
company and entertainment. We also need help with feeding and turning of our more disabled
residents.”

The matchmaking chatbot SiP will connect the actor and the Elder Care.

## Team Description
We are a multidisciplinary and multinational team who shared the same idea and joined forces to
help hack the crisis. The team consists of a mix of people with competences within project
management, business development, programming, graphic design and IT security, with experiences
from both the private and public sector. Furthermore, we are interested in how the society
works, the political system, reading, dancing, singing and how to make use of our obvious and
hidden skills in our daily life.
